# TODO
[ ] Make validation set containing same ratio of dog and cat classes
[ ] Make evaluator. Evaluate a given image dir with inference graph
[ ] Test submission on Kaggle. See public leaderboard result
[ ] Try multiple model ensemble and see changes on public leader board
[ ] Add image augmentatio (horizontal flip, image jitter, random crop)


[v] Pull out global_step var in train.py. Use it for save/load and logging.
[v] Enable tensorboard draw graph for train loss, train acc, val loss, val acc
[v] Loader/Saver implementation.
